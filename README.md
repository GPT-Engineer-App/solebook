# solebook

Create an accounting single page app to track my sneaker side-hustle. It should support: 

â€¢ Adding a new transaction with details such as date, amount, type (income/expense), and category (dropdown with e.g. sneaker brand)
â€¢ View a list of my sneaker purchases, showing details like date, amount, type, and brand
â€¢ Edit an existing sneaker purchase in case I made an error or an update is needed
â€¢ Delete a sneaker purchase if it was added by mistake or is no longer relevant

Feel free to add some placeholder transactions.
